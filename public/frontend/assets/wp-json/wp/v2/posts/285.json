Garlic Contains Compounds With Potent Medicinal Properties<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic is a plant in the Allium (onion) family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is closely related to onions, shallots and leeks. Each segment of a garlic bulb is called a clove. There are about 10\u201320 cloves in a single bulb, give or take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic grows in many parts of the world and is a popular ingredient in cooking due to its strong smell and delicious taste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, throughout ancient history, the main use of garlic was for its health and medicinal properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its use was well documented by many major civilizations, including the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans and Chinese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists now know that most of its health benefits are caused by sulfur compounds formed when a garlic clove is chopped, crushed or chewed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most famous of those is known as allicin. However, allicin is an unstable compound that is only briefly present in fresh garlic after it\u2019s been cut or crushed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other compounds that may play a role in garlic\u2019s health benefits include diallyl disulfide and s-allyl cysteine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sulfur compounds from garlic enter the body from the digestive tract and travel all over the body, where it exerts its potent biological effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>2. Garlic Is Highly Nutritious But Has Very Few Calories<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calorie for calorie, garlic is incredibly nutritious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One clove (3 grams) of raw garlic contains:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Manganese:<\/strong>&nbsp;2% of the Daily Value (DV)<\/li><li><strong>Vitamin B6:&nbsp;<\/strong>2% of the DV<\/li><li><strong>Vitamin C:<\/strong>&nbsp;1% of the DV<\/li><li><strong>Selenium:<\/strong>&nbsp;1% of the DV<\/li><li><strong>Fiber:<\/strong>&nbsp;0.06 grams<\/li><li>Decent amounts of calcium, copper, potassium, phosphorus, iron and vitamin B1<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes with 4.5 calories, 0.2 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic also contains trace amounts of various other nutrients. In fact, it contains a little bit of almost everything you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>4. The Active Compounds in Garlic Can Reduce Blood Pressure<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes are the world&#8217;s biggest killers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the most important drivers of these diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human studies have found garlic supplements to have a significant impact on reducing blood pressure in people with high blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one study, 600\u20131,500 mg of aged garlic extract was just as effective as the drug Atenolol at reducing blood pressure over a 24-week period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supplement doses must be fairly high to have the desired effects. The amount needed is equivalent to about four cloves of garlic per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>5. Garlic Improves Cholesterol Levels, Which May Lower the Risk of Heart Disease<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic can lower total and&nbsp;LDL&nbsp;cholesterol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with high cholesterol, garlic supplements appear to reduce total and\/or LDL cholesterol by about 10\u201315%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at LDL (the &#8220;bad&#8221;) and HDL (the &#8220;good&#8221;) cholesterol specifically, garlic appears to lower LDL but has no reliable effect on HDL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High triglyceride levels are another known risk factor for heart disease, but garlic seems to have no significant effects on triglyceride levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>6. Garlic Contains Antioxidants That May Help Prevent Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease and Dementia<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxidative damage from free radicals contributes to the aging process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic contains antioxidants that support the body&#8217;s protective mechanisms against oxidative damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High doses of garlic supplements have been shown to increase antioxidant enzymes in humans, as well as significantly reduce oxidative stress in those with high blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combined effects on reducing cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as the antioxidant properties, may reduce the risk of common brain diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and dementia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>7. Garlic May Help You Live Longer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential effects of garlic on longevity are basically impossible to prove in humans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But given the beneficial effects on important risk factors like blood pressure, it makes sense that garlic could&nbsp;help you live longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that it can fight infectious disease is also an important factor, because these are common causes of death, especially in the elderly or people with dysfunctional immune systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>8. Athletic Performance Might Be Improved With Garlic Supplements<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic was one of the earliest &#8220;performance enhancing&#8221; substances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was traditionally used in ancient cultures to reduce fatigue and enhance the work capacity of laborers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most notably, it was given to Olympic athletes in ancient Greece.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodent studies have shown that garlic helps with exercise performance, but very few human studies have been done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People with heart disease who took garlic oil for 6 weeks had a 12% reduction in peak heart rate and better exercise capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a study on nine competitive cyclists found no performance benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other studies suggest that exercise-induced fatigue may be reduced with garlic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>9. Eating Garlic May Help Detoxify Heavy Metals in the Body<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At high doses, the sulfur compounds in garlic have been shown to protect against organ damage from heavy metal toxicity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A four-week study in employees of a car battery plant (excessive exposure to lead) found that garlic reduced lead levels in the blood by 19%. It also reduced many clinical signs of toxicity, including headaches and blood pressure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three doses of garlic each day even outperformed the drug D-penicillamine in reducing symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>10. Garlic May Improve Bone Health<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No human studies have measured the effects of garlic on bone loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, rodent studies have shown that it can minimize bone loss by increasing estrogen in females.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One study in&nbsp;menopausal women&nbsp;found that a daily dose of dry garlic extract (equal to 2 grams of raw garlic) significantly decreased a marker of estrogen deficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This suggests that this supplement may have beneficial effects on bone health in women.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foods like garlic and onions may also have beneficial effects on osteoarthritis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>11. Garlic Is Easy to Include in Your Diet and Tastes Absolutely Delicious<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one is not a health benefit, but is still important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic is very easy (and delicious) to include in your current diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It complements most savory dishes, particularly soups and sauces. The strong taste of garlic can also add a punch to otherwise bland recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garlic comes in several forms, from whole cloves and smooth pastes to powders and supplements like garlic extract and garlic oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, keep in mind that there are some downsides to garlic, such as bad breath. There are also some people who are allergic to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood-thinning medications, talk to your doctor before increasing your garlic intake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common way to use garlic is to press a few cloves of fresh garlic with a garlic press, then mix it with&nbsp;extra virgin olive oil&nbsp;and a bit of salt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This a healthy and super satisfying dressing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The Bottom Line<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For thousands of years, garlic was believed to have medicinal properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Science has now confirmed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sources and References:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/11-proven-health-benefits-of-garlic#section12\">https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/11-proven-health-benefits-of-garlic#section12<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food.&#8221; Those are famous words from the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, often called the father of Western medicine.
